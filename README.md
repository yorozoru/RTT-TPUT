# RTT/Throughput Measurement Protocol

## Overview
This protocol facilitates the measurement of Round-Trip Time (RTT) and throughput between a server and a client. It offers flexibility in data transmission modes to enable accurate performance evaluation.

## Components
1. **Server**: Built in Java, the server orchestrates data transmission and measurement calculations.
2. **Client**: Implemented in Python, enabling communication with the server and analysis of received data.
